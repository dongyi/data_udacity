## Project 4: Explore and Summarize Data

### Overview

In this project, we use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to 
explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a 
selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies. This data set is 
about red wine quality. It contains some chemical properties for each wine. At 
least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 
0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). We want to determine which chemical 
properties influence the quality of red wines.
